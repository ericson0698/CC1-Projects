	<style="font-family:Timesnewroman;><P> <h1><font color="white">To start off, let me introduce myself, I am Ericson Rosario Martinez Born and raised here in Baguio and I also live here and I am currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Major in Web Development. I am 20 years old and I already have a working experience as a customer service representative with two companies first is Sitel Baguio from 2016 - 2017 and second is Intelinet Global Services Manila from 2017 - 2018 I ended up quitting my last job to pursue my college education here at the University of Cordillera. I was once a student of this university and that's SY: 2015-2016 I failed to pursue my education by that time due to Computer Addiction and that event made me think that I should work in order to survive, that's why I tried to apply for a work and as I have mentioned, I did get a job twice and those years made me think if working like this as a call center agent is worth the waste of time, and education by that time I was in manila striving to earn money which lead me to a decision to quit my job go back home and pursue my education. now that I'm studying I'm hoping that this time I won't be making any mistakes for me to be able to graduate</h1> </P></font>
